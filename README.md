Summer 2016 UCSD Research Experiment Game for Frontiers Science Journal

  This experiment was to test if a subject's creativity could be affected by a game with two different scenarios. The game's premise is to find a way inside the building while the player has misplaced his/her keys. The first scenario primes a narrow form of attention and prompts the player to undergo a search for his/her lost keys in order to unlock the door and enter the building. This narrow form of attention where the player is focused on finding his/her keys is also expected to limit the subject's creativity for a short period of time. In contrast, the second scenario primes a broad form of attention and prompts the player to find an alternate form of entry (breaking a window, climbing down the chimney, etc.). This broad form of attention where the player is analyzing the environment for multiple paths is expected to boost a subject's creativity for a short period of time. 
  
  Speculation of whether or not the narrow scenario "limits" or "less effectively boosts" will be looked at after data has been collected before, after, and during the game experiment.
